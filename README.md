Ostrich algorithm In computer science, the ostrich algorithm is a strategy of ignoring potential problems on the basis that they may be exceedingly rare. 
It is named after the ostrich effect which is defined as "to stick one's head in the sand and pretend there is no problem". 
It is used when it is more cost-effective to allow the problem to occur than to attempt its prevention.
